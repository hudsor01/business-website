I'm excited to apply for the Senior Partner Operations Manager role at Customer.io. With a strong background in Revenue Operations, I've spent the past several years architecting and optimizing systems, processes, and analytics frameworks that have driven substantial growth and efficiency at a SaaS called Thryv.

I led initiatives that scaled our partner network by 2,200%, leveraging Salesforce and Power BI to achieve 95% forecast accuracy. I also automated complex commission systems, significantly reducing processing time while maintaining 100% accuracy.

My experience managing agencies, MSPs and affiliate networks through automating processes and streamlining onboarding workflows using Workato and PartnerStack, aligns directly with your goal of enabling and scaling effective partner ecosystems.

I excel in cross-functional environments, building infrastructure that connects Revenue Operations, Sales Enablement and Partner Management teams. I understand the levers that drive partner performance and I have passion for creating clarity through structured, data-driven strategies.

Customer.io's commitment to scalable partner operations resonates deeply with my experience and skill set. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your ongoing success.
