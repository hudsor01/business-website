## Core Development Principles

1. **No Barrel Files**: 
   - Do not create index.ts files in any directory
   - No barrel exports or re-exporting through index files
   - Import directly from source files, never from directories

2. **No Enhanced/Prefixed Components**:
   - Never create files with prefixes like "enhanced", "optimized", "simple", "advanced", etc.
   - Instead of creating "enhancedHeader.tsx", update the existing "header.tsx" file
   - Consolidate functionality into the original file rather than creating variants
   - Follow DRY principles - one component, one responsibility

3. **Tailwind CSS v4 Zero-Config**:
   - NO tailwind.config.js file - everything is configured in CSS
   - All configuration done via @theme directive in globals.css
   - Uses zero-configuration content detection (no content paths needed)
   - Theme variables use proper namespaces (--color-*, --text-*, etc.)

## Project Architecture

### Hybrid API Architecture

The project uses a **dual API approach** for maximum compatibility:

1. **tRPC (Primary)**: Type-safe API with React Query integration
   - Located in `app/api/trpc/routers/`
   - Unified router pattern in `unified-router.ts`
   - Domain-based sub-routers (contact, newsletter, analytics, lead-magnet, auth)

2. **REST Endpoints (Compatibility)**: Traditional REST endpoints that internally call tRPC
   - Located in `app/api/[endpoint]/route.ts`
   - Provides compatibility for webhooks and external integrations
   - Enhanced security with comprehensive validation

**Key Pattern**: All business logic lives in tRPC routers, REST endpoints are thin wrappers that call tRPC procedures internally with enhanced security validation.

### State Management Pattern

**Three-layer State Architecture**:
1. **Server State**: React Query + tRPC for all API data
2. **Client State**: Zustand stores organized by domain
   - `analytics-store.ts` - Page view and event tracking
   - `form-store.ts` - Form submission states and validation
   - `ui-store.ts` - Loading states, modals, notifications
3. **Component State**: React Hook Form for form-specific state

## Development Patterns

### Server Components First (React 19)
- Default to Server Components (no `'use client'` directive)
- Only add `'use client'` when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Keep data fetching in Server Components where possible
- Use React 19 Server Actions for form handling

### Secure Form Implementation Pattern
1. Create form schema in `lib/validation/form-schemas.ts` with comprehensive validation
2. Add tRPC procedure in appropriate router with security middleware
3. Create form component extending `BaseForm` with security features
4. Add email template if form sends emails
5. Create REST endpoint wrapper with enhanced security validation
6. Implement rate limiting and spam protection
7. Add security logging and monitoring

### Component Creation Guidelines
- Use domain-driven naming: `entity-action.tsx` (e.g., `contact-form.tsx`)
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Follow progressive enhancement (work without JavaScript)
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Apply security considerations (input validation, XSS prevention)

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# Core Application
NODE_ENV=production          # development, production, or test
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=         # Your site URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com)
DATABASE_URL=                # PostgreSQL connection string

# Email (Required)
RESEND_API_KEY=              # Resend API key for email delivery
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=           # Verified sending domain
CONTACT_EMAIL=               # Receives form submissions

# Security (ENHANCED - Required)
JWT_SECRET=                  # JWT signing secret (MINIMUM 32 chars, NO DEFAULTS)
ADMIN_USERNAME=              # Admin username (NOT 'admin' in production)
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=         # bcrypt hash for production (REQUIRED in production)
ADMIN_PASSWORD=              # Plain password for development only

# Supabase (Optional - for enhanced auth/database features)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=    # Supabase project URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= # Supabase anonymous key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=   # Supabase service role key

# Analytics (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID= # Google Analytics measurement ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=     # PostHog analytics key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=    # PostHog host URL
```

### Security Requirements for Production
1. **JWT_SECRET**: Must be 32+ characters, cannot use defaults like 'your-secret-key'
2. **ADMIN_USERNAME**: Cannot be 'admin' in production, must be unique
3. **ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH**: Required in production, use bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
4. **Environment Validation**: All security variables validated at startup

## Code Quality Standards

### File Naming and Consolidation
- **No Enhanced/Prefixed Files**: Consolidate enhanced-, optimized-, improved- files into originals
- **Direct Imports**: Import from source files, never from directories or barrel files
- **Type Organization**: All types in `/types` directory, no inline type definitions
- **Enum Centralization**: All enums in `/types/enum-types.ts`

### Security Implementation
- **No Duplication**: Consolidate all redundant implementations
- **Type Safety**: Replace all `any` types with proper types from `/types` directory
- **Error Handling**: Use standardized error handling patterns with security awareness
- **Performance**: Monitor Core Web Vitals impact of all features
- **Security**: Apply security-first development practices throughout
